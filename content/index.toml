**bla**zing fast
 **de**ad simple
  **s**tatic site generator

</code>

Blades is made to do one job and do it well - generate HTML files from the provided
content using the provided templates.  
Thanks to the amazing [Ramhorns](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/ramhorns) templating engine,
[zero-copy](https://serde.rs/lifetimes.html#borrowing-data-in-a-derived-impl) deserialisation
and [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) parallel iterators, it renders the whole site in
milliseconds, possibly up to [10 times](https://github.com/grego/ssg-bench) faster than other generators like Hugo.

It's made for easy setup and use. A static site generator should be a no brainer.
It uses [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) templates with extremely minimal
and obvious syntax (really, like 7 rules!), while providing the necessary building blocks
to let you focus on your content.

You may categorise your pages into taxonomies (like categories or tags), use the usual features
like pagination or breadcrumbs and even generate image galleries.  
Sitemap and RSS feed are automatically rendered.  
All done without hassle, faster than you blink.

## Why not _`blades`_?
Unlike other monolithic generators, Blades is modest in its scope. All it does is generating your site.
It doesn't do any fancy stuff like transpiling Haskell to minified Javascript, or ever
watching the site for changes. For that, you can use a dedicated tool like
[caretaker](https://github.com/grego/caretaker).

Nevertheless, if you have a feature request or ran into some issue using Blades, please submit an
[issue](https://github.com/grego/blades). It is a hobby project, so any contribution
is welcome! `:)`

## Why _`blades`_?
They shave the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) off.
